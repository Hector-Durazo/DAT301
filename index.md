## Welcome to DAT 301 Exploring Data in R and Python!

This course focuses on first steps in data processing and exploratory data analysis, which include: data cleaning (tidying), data manipulation (wrangling, munging), exploratory data analysis (visualization, plots, summaries), as well as some statis- tical procedures for model fitting and predicting (linear regression models, trees, clustering).

### Announcements:
