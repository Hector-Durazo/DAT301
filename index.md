## Welcome to DAT 301 Exploring Data in R and Python!

This course focuses on first steps in data processing and exploratory data analysis, which include: data cleaning (tidying), data manipulation (wrangling, munging), exploratory data analysis (visualization, plots, summaries), as well as some statis- tical procedures for model fitting and predicting (linear regression models, trees, clustering).

### Announcements:

* All the video recordings can now be found at `canvas -> zoom -> could recordings`. I will not post it at `modules` as the space is limited.
* Lecture notes have been uploaded to `canvas --> files --> lecture_notes`. You can download them from there if you have trouble with `Github`.
* Homework 2 is avaible at [mathds.asu.edu](mathds.asu.edu). Log in with your ASU ID. Due **11:59pm Frida 10/02/2020**. Please start early and post questions on Slack.
